        // 1. Create a new Tone.js Synth
        const synth = new Tone.Synth().toDestination();
        // Set the release time for the envelope
        synth.envelope.release = 0.2;

        // 2. Get a reference to the button
        const playButton = document.getElementById('playButton');

        // 3. Add an event listener to the button
        playButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
            // 4a. Call Tone.start()
            await Tone.start();
            console.log('AudioContext started');

            // 4b. Use the synth to trigger an attack and release
            // The note "C4" will play for a duration of an 8th note ("8n")
            // The attack velocity is 1 (maximum)
            synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n", Tone.now());
            // The note will sustain for 0.8 seconds, and then release over 0.2 seconds (as set by synth.envelope.release)
            // This explicit triggerRelease is not strictly necessary if triggerAttackRelease's duration parameter
            // and the synth's release envelope are set correctly.
            // However, to ensure the 0.8s sustain and 0.2s release, we can schedule it.
            // For simplicity matching the prompt: triggerAttackRelease handles the duration.
            // The prompt mentions "After 0.8 seconds, trigger a release that lasts 0.2 seconds".
            // triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n") will play C4 for the duration of an 8th note.
            // If we want exactly 0.8s duration and then 0.2s release:
            // synth.triggerAttack("C4", Tone.now());
            // synth.triggerRelease(Tone.now() + 0.8);
            // For this case, let's use triggerAttackRelease with a duration that approximates 0.8s
            // or stick to the simpler "8n" and rely on the envelope.
            // Let's use the simpler triggerAttackRelease with "8n" as it's common.
            // The prompt's "After 0.8 seconds, trigger a release that lasts 0.2 seconds"
            // is best achieved by setting the synth's envelope and using triggerAttackRelease with a duration.
            // Let's assume "8n" is close enough to 0.8s for this example, or adjust if specific timing is critical.
            // A more precise way for 0.8s duration before release starts:
            // synth.triggerAttack("C4", Tone.now());
            // synth.triggerRelease(Tone.now() + 0.8);
            // Given the prompt "The note should sustain for 0.8 seconds." and then "trigger a release that lasts 0.2 seconds"
            // this implies an explicit control over sustain.
            // So, attack now, release after 0.8s. The release phase itself will take 0.2s.

            // Corrected approach for explicit 0.8s sustain:
            synth.triggerAttack("C4", Tone.now());
            synth.triggerRelease(Tone.now() + 0.8); // Release starts after 0.8 seconds
                                                  // and will last for synth.envelope.release (0.2s)
            console.log('Tone played');
        });
