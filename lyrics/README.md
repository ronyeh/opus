Use CSS animations to make a "lyric video".

Show the lyrics of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.

Each word has a different size (from 18pt to 32pt), color, stroke, and rotation (from -45 degrees to +45 degrees).

Add a button to "Start" the animation.

Once I click the button, each word in the song fades out one after another. The fade out time is 1.0 seconds.
